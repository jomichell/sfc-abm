    "The class `SimVars` is designed to overcome the problem of cumbersome algebraic syntax in models. In general, variables need to be kept out of the root namespace. But accessing variables in dictionaries is syntactically cumbersome and makes algebra difficult to read. For example, consider the macroeconomic identity $$Y = C + I$$ Ideally we'd like to be able to code this as `Y = C + I`, but this requires the three variables to defined in the root namespace. If the variables are stored in a dictionary, d, this becomes `d['Y'] = d['C'] + c['I']`. This is significantly more annoying to type, and also substantially harder to read. `SimVars` offers a compromise by allowing 'dot notation': \n"
